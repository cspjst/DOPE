# Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment (DOPE)
## A Historical Re-creation in C
Exploring the spirit and implementation of Dartmouth's precursor to BASIC as an interpreter written in C.

## Synopsis
The Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment (DOPE) was a programming language developed at Dartmouth College. It was designed by Professor John G. Kemeny:

> "...to be used in an experiment to teach a large number of freshmen the rudiments of programming in a course of three one-hour lectures."
> — *Teaching Notes - Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment,May 1962* 

The DOPE compiler was written and tested by Sydney Marshall, a freshman research assistant at Dartmouth for the Dartmouth Computation Center's LGP-30 computer. 

The compiler was written by **Sidney Marshall**, a freshman research assistant, for the **LGP-30** computer.

> “It is a universal language. Any problem that the machine is capable of handling can be written in DOPE.”
> — *Teaching Notes, May 1962* 

DOPE has been largely lost to history, overshadowed by its famous successor, BASIC. For decades, details were scarce, existing mostly in academic footnotes and a single, unpublished manuscript by Kemeny. Recently, efforts like Sean Haas's work for VICE unearthed crucial documents, offering a rare glimpse into this "radically different approach to programming" that, while not successful in its own right, was the essential stepping stone to BASIC.

I am grateful to the Rauner Special Collections Library, for locating the Thomas Kurtz papers and photocopying the "Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment (DOPE)" teaching notes and providing them to me for this work.

## DOPE 

Recreating DOPE is not an act of nostalgia, rather, it is an act of understanding, of tracing the roots of accessible computing. At that watershed time of transition from the point when only programmers could use computers towards an egalitarian future where anyone and everyone could, and would, be able to use a computer. These ideas of the liberalisation of computing were forming in a number minds and the Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment (DOPE) was a seminal, but somewhat forgotten, step in that direction. A direction that would lead to one of the most liberating computer programming languages the world would see - the Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC).
